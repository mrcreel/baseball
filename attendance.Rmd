## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

**Load Packages and Data**
```{r load packages}
library("tidyverse")
team <- read.csv("./data/team.csv")

head(team)
```

**Trim _team_ dataset and add average attendance and seasons variables**
```{r tbl_team}
tbl_team <- team %>%
    group_by(park) %>%
    filter(!is.na(attendance),
           !is.na(ghome),
           park != "") %>%
    select(year:ws_win,
           name:attendance) %>%
    mutate(avg_attendance = as.integer(attendance / ghome),
           seasons = n())

tbl_team
```

## Attendance Boxplot

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r attendance boxplot, echo=FALSE}
tbl_team %>% 
    filter(year >= 1969, seasons > 2) %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x = factor(park), y = avg_attendance)) +
    geom_boxplot() + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
