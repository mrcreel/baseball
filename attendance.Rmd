## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

**Load Packages and Data**
```{r load packages}
library("tidyverse")
team <- read.csv("./data/team.csv")

head(team)
```

**Trim ~~team~~ dataset and add average attendance and seasons variables**
```{r tbl_team}
tbl_team <- team %>%
    filter(!is.na(attendance),
           !is.na(ghome),
           park != "") %>%
    select(year:ws_win,
           name:attendance) %>%
    mutate(avg_attendance = as.integer(attendance / ghome)) %>%
    as_tibble()

tbl_team
```

**Build outlier function**

By <http://stackoverflow.com/users/2572423/jasonaizkalns>

From <http://stackoverflow.com/a/33525389/6269439>
```{r outlier}
is_outlier <- function(x) {
    return(x < quantile(x, 0.25) - 1.5 * IQR(x) | x > quantile(x, 0.75) + 1.5 * IQR(x))
}
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
